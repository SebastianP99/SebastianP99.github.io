### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 2 was a favorite of mine because it was really fascinating that a program could find the average of any sequence of numbers. This lab was one of the first times that I really started to understand loops and how to use boolean variables. Even though this lab may seem simple to others I find it really cool and even convenient for everyday uses.

* Lab 8
    
    Lab 8, part 3 was one of my favorite labs because it played a really awesome looking Christmas animation. This was the first time I used the chrono header file which slows down the program to be able to run animations smoothly. I learned that programs can be slowed to produce animations.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 3 was one of my favorites because it was the first time that we used colors and RGB in class. I learned how to use RGB values and the Magick++.h file header which made making colors really fun. I really enjoyed the final gradient that was created at the end of the lab.
